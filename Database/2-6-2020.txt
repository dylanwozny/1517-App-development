Insert continued 

two things today

handling the foreign keys

Validation tommorow..... ?

when the option is availible, let the user choose from a list of choices

load a list dynamically from the database
with drop down list


in code notes------

looping fro each through supplier and catagory to create drop down lists

<option> inside for each is supplierid/catagoryid is to identify,
but we use supplier.name/catagory.name for what is displayed !

.IsNullorEmpty is good for text box, but not for drop down list
use .Equals("0")
0 must be in brackets because values returned from cdatabse are always in strings


extra logic in for each....
keeping information retained in drop down text box upon submit, so it doesnt defualt back to very first selection.
Selected in <option> retains the selected value !


//get the identity value of the last inserted record.
        var x = db.GetLastInsertId();

//display a successmessage
	<p class="col-md-12 text-center">
		<span style="color:green"><strong>New Product Added @x  </strong></span>
	</p>



Exercise 3
first image is example of the bad way to do it !
