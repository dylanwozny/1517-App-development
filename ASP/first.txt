Click on element in editor and look at properties to see what is modified !

Literal is like label
- label proerties can be changed, literal cannot be changed

- designer mode can be done by pressing at bottom of window editor

------------------------------

when press me button is pressed, this code will be executed in  helloWorld.aspx.cs
called event driven logic
event was the pressing of the button

id acts as the variable name

values are always in strings when returing to C# from form
