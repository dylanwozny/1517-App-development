Like an assembly line

what weve been doing
-browser to web server

webapp sends request to BLL
- BLL has classes and methods 
- BLL DOES NOT  touch database
- BLL asks DAL through entity framework
- DAL uses entity framework to interact with DB


ENTITY CLASS
- series of properties in entity class that reflects the attributes on the databse
- Once entities are mapped, they can be used by each other classes
- we will put in code so the entity crashes when we have errors



--------------------------------------------

add class to entities folder
make public in code

add reference
- data annotaitons
- data entity
(check refrences of dons project to double check)

add table code to top(look at code) to state what table your using

add namespace under defaults, seperate so you know the non defaults

creating properties from table attributes....

[key] => this identifies the attribute to be a primary key.
[key, column(order = 1)] means the it is a compound primary key (more notes in don's code)

DatabaseGenerated handles generated primary keys 


When creating entity table in code

data types
check if null or not nullable


adding in validation above/ in front of property attribue...


Read only properties:
- just makes repetative things easier
- likes combining name and id in a concocinated string. just call the property.
- [not mapped]
- no 'set'

EXERCISE

- this covers page number 2 !


------setting up connection string to db

add "web config" to solution

same as razor connection string format (look at dons code)

- new file
- adding code to current web config
- adding in entity framework xml code so it crashes when wrong
- make sure you have entity framework packages....
- must close file if updating nuget enity framrwork package
(check github history for dons changes...)

do not rename in file explorer tab
- if you do, just delete the project and recreate


--------CREATE class in DAL Folder..

add in northwind system namespace
and entity namespace...


now you can do all of the exercise....done by monday...
