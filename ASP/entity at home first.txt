territory primary key

-primary key is a string
-need generated key....

DAL
- entities set singular
- db sets are plural
- tables are set here with db and plural naming convention

-Dons diagram online for architecture
- DAL interacts with database
- entities are the MAP for DAL's database interaction 
- we need to go through DAL class to interact with front end webpage
- BLL is the area where the classes DAL and front end(webapp) interact
- web page can only make a call to BLL, then interacts with DAL and entities,
they retreive from database, then return to BLL and Webapp.


BLL
need to add using clause at beggining if accessing classes outside your namespace

Region controller

- entity framework does most of the work. only need return and make it to a list



BLL (contains tables info)

- add using add top so it can access db namespace
- just copy and paste from other examples.
- change table names, dont forget the plural table names
- change to appropriate primary key
- change to public
- rebuild solution


WEBPAGE(search)

- format with boostrap, not bootwrap
- click on search button in design
- add code to onclick event as seen in dons notes !
- dont use a string when you have a catch. use "ex"
- other error messages a string is fine just not catch
- everything are classes, adhere to all the rules of classes.
- in try
- define a class to use
- then use class method
- product query list: information in list is loaded when page is first loaded
- remember to put if(page.post is back)
