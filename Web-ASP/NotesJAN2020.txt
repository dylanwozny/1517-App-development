MCV 5 With layout razor for content pages

If you have a complicated webpage, use a seperate file to format the layout page
isntead of edititng the layout.

@RenderSection() for each block that is not body

required: false means it doesnt need to be one every page !


For Css formatting
Rclick webapp > manage NuGet > search bootstrap > install
go to update tab at top > update jQuery.

custom css file in content folder of boostrap

copy and paste styles you want to overwrite from bootstrap into your own style page

to make a custom layout page called _menu
create a seperate menu page MCV 5 with layout razor, delete content on it.

using menu layout on _layout.
 @RenderPage("~/_menu.cshtml")

every radio button needs a value to asscoite what is clicked

do css layout before logic !

dont push until end, do small commits and if there is a problem then revert a commit in history.
